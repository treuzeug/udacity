INSTALLATION

Theese libraries should be imported ; matplotlib, pandas, math, numpy.

PROJECT MOTIVATION

Find if there is a cross under a site or not.
If two or more cells under a site serves each others areas, these cells have cross possibilities.
This project only works for 2 cells.

Why do we have to fix Crosses?
It increases the efficiency of planning and optimization works.
Clear database make us optimize the Network clearer.

FILE DESCTRIPTIONS

You can see Cell_Azimuth.xlsx file contains 2 cells with their event points.
There is 6 columns like :  Cell,event locations,site locations and Cell's actual azimuth value.
Please look at the Azimuth_project.ipynb file to understand how the system works.

RESULT

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available at .
